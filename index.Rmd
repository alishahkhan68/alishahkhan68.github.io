# Welcome!
I'm Alishah, a second-year MPH student at Columbia University. I'm passionate about healthtech, femtech and using epidemiological methods to further women's health research.

## Who I Am
An avid matcha enthusiast, trail runner and Yankee-hater (go Sox!), I'm a UC Berkeley graduate who never hesitates to admit that she's currently on the wrong coast. Down the road, I want to found my own femtech company in the hormone health space.
