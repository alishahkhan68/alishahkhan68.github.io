[Resume](Resume_AlishahKhan_F24.pdf)

I’m an epidemiologist with a passion for launching innovative femtech solutions and exploring the intersection of women's health and infectious disease. With a background in health economics, statistical analysis and public health research, I’m dedicated to advancing the women's health landscape—especially given that women were only included in clinical trials starting 30 years ago. There’s still so much to discover and address in this space, from chronic conditions to reproductive health and beyond. If you’re interested in trends in femtech, the role of epidemiology in entrepreneurship, or ways we can shape the future of women’s health together, I’d love to connect. Let’s chat about how we can make a meaningful impact!
